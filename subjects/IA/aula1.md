# Aula 1

## Resumo do estudo sobre a aula 1 do curso FastAI

### Artificial Inteligence
* Do you need lots of math? No just high school math is sufficient
* Lots of data? No
* Lots of expensive computers? No
* A phd? No
* Five areas where DL is the best in the world
    - Biology
    - Robotics
    - Medicine
    - Playing games
    - Image generation
* What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of artificial neuron?
    - Perceptrons
* The requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP) are:
    - Processing units
    - State of activation
    - Output function
    - Pattern of connectivity
    - Propagation rule
    - Activation rule
    - Learning rule
    - Environment

* The misunderstandings were that a single layer wouldn’t be able to learn and 

* GPU – graphics processing unit

* Traditional computer programs are hard to use to recognize a images in a photo because of the need of explain the computer every steps

* Weight assignment as Samuel explained is what we call weights

* The high amount of layers a DL model can have makes it hard to identify what factors determine the final output

* Universal approximation Theorem: a theory that suggests an artificial neural network can represent a wide range of functions when given the appropriate parameters

* To train a model you need a model, hyperparameters, dataset, loss function and optimization function, you need to split the dataset into training, validation and test sets, selecting the model selecting the hyperparameters, making the predictions, calculating the loss and updating the parameters

* Positive feedback loop: a circumstance where the predictions produce outcomes that reinforce the same predictions

* We don’t always have to use the 224x224 pixel images

* Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning that classifies the unseen data as one or more category values.
* Regression is a subcategory of supervised learning that predicts the dependent variables as a continuous value.

* A validation set is a subset of the dataset that isn’t used to train the model. It can be used to produce an unbiased evaluation of the model. Its needed to fine-tune he model

* Test set is a subset of the dataset that isn’t used to train of validate the model. It can be used to produce the last unbiased evaluation of the model because the model. Its needed to measure the true performance of the model

* It automatically creates a validation set using 20% of the total training data
